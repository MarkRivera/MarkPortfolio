    <p>
       The web has opened limitless possibilities and its up to me to discover them. My favorite languages to develop in are <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. Keeping users interested as they browse is a main focus when I develop. I've worked with many small businesses and freelancers to create the app (or pages) they really deserve, and I can do that for you too.
